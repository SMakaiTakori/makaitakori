    <div class="bio">
        <p>I currently live in Atlanta, GA and am a full-time Nanny and part-time preschool teacher. I love working with
        children because of the creative and fun environments I get to be a part of every day, and even though I enjoy
        this, I have discovered that I also have a passion for coding! I first thought about changing my career in March
        of 2016, and since then I have made it my mission to learn as much about the world of programming as possible.
        I began by attending Meetups in order to network with others in my community and from there I discovered
        Girl Develop It. I took my first HTML5 and CSS3 beginner course through this non-profit organization and loved
        it from the very first class. After that, I applied and received two GDI scholarships which allowed me to attend
        their intermediate HTML and CSS class, and later their beginner JavaScript course.</p>

        <p>Since then, I have been practicing my HTML and CSS skills by building various websites, which you can see on my
        <a href="https://github.com/SMakaiTakori" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and am continuing to learn and strengthen
        my JavaScript skills through online resources such as FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, and the Firehose project. I am excited
        to keep growing my programming knowledge, because in the long-term I would love to be able to teach children how
        to code. Currently, I would like to acquire a position at a tech company or startup that allows me to keep building
        my current skillset, while also encouraging the development of new skills.</p>

        <p>When I’m not coding, I am hanging out with my family, playing with my puppy, or I’m on Pinterest finding new DIY
        crafting ideas and fun science experiments to do with the kids, so check out my social media links below to find
        out more about me!</p>
